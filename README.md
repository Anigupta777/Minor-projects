# Minor-projects
These include two minor projects( Rock-Paper-Scissor(using user statistics)) and (Tic-Tac-toe(using user statistics)).

In Rock-Paper-Scissor:
Using the power of NumPy for efficient array operations and Pandas for data manipulation to create a fun and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
By combining the power of NumPy for numerical operations and Pandas for data management,
this implementation of Rock-Paper-Scissors becomes not only a simple game but also an opportunity to practice using these popular Python libraries.
Players can enjoy the game, track their performance, and have fun while learning to work with data structures and arrays in Python.


In Tic-Tac-Toe:
By combining the efficiency of NumPy with the data handling capabilities of pandas, you can create a clean, interactive,and well-organized implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe.
This approach not only makes the code more manageable but also provides an opportunity to explore the capabilities of these powerful Python libraries.
Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this project can be a rewarding way to deepen your understanding of NumPy, pandas, and game logic.
